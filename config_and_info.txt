[Config]

; categoricalscatter.py will make a plot out of text files containing tab-delimited data,
;   where the first line is headings. On Windows at least, you can just copy a selection of
;   cells and paste into your text file, and it will paste as tab-deliminited.

; categoricalscatter.py requires Python to be installed. I used the latest version, recent ones may work.
; During installation, choose to associate files with Python when prompted for simplicity.

; Next, you need to install Bokeh and scipy. 
; Windows: if you did not choose to add Python to environment variables, then go to the folder:
; C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\
; Then, run a Command Prompt (or PowerShell) window in that folder, by typing 'cmd' into
;   the address bar and pressing enter.
; Mac/Linux: find the ...python/scripts folder, and open a terminal in it
; In the terminal or Command Prompt, run the command 'pip install bokeh'
; When that is complete, run 'pip install scipy' in the same terminal.

; To run categoricalscatter.py, first download this folder somewhere if you have not
; Then, drag the data text file onto dragdrop.py.
; Unfortunately, that may not work outside of Windows.
; In case dragging does not work, input the file name here, and run nodragdrop.py

data_file = YourDataFilesName.txt

; If you want to automatically make a png and svg, first install what is described in https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/output/export.html
; This is a more difficult requirement. This is not required for just making an html file.
; If doing the Firefox route (and if Windows), (somewhat similar for Chrome), put the bokehdriver
;   in a folder by itself. Then, put a symlink to firefox.exe in that folder too.
; Add that folder's path to User variables: Path in environment variables. 
; Chrome/MacOS steps may be similar, but I am not sure.
; Then, run dragdrop_svgpng.py or nodrag_drop_svgpng.py
